# YOLO-V4-IMAGE-DETECTION

# Project Title

YOLOv4 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that can accurately detect and locate objects within images and video streams. It is an upgrade to YOLOv3, and incorporates many new features and improvements to achieve even better accuracy and speed.

Here are some key features of YOLOv4:

Improved Backbone Architecture: YOLOv4 uses a more powerful and efficient backbone architecture, which allows for better feature extraction and faster computation.

Mish Activation Function: YOLOv4 uses the Mish activation function, which has been shown to outperform traditional activation functions like ReLU and Leaky ReLU.

Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and Path Aggregation Network (PAN): YOLOv4 incorporates both SPP and PAN to help the network better detect objects at different scales and resolutions.



Darknet-53: YOLOv4 uses Darknet-53 as its backbone architecture, which is a modified version of the ResNet architecture.

Bag of Freebies (BoF) and Bag of Specials (BoS): YOLOv4 incorporates BoF and BoS to improve the training process and further improve detection accuracy.

Dynamic Convolution: YOLOv4 uses dynamic convolution to adaptively adjust the kernel size and shape based on the input data, which can help improve detection accuracy.

Weighted-Residual Connections (WRC): YOLOv4 uses WRC to help the network better learn and represent complex features.

Cross Stage Partial Network (CSP): YOLOv4 uses CSP to help improve feature fusion and reduce computation.

Overall, YOLOv4 is a highly advanced and effective object detection algorithm that can be used for a wide range of applications, from autonomous driving to surveillance and security.
